# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Project was to figure out which neighbourhood is good to buy property and predicting the earnings for the airbnb.

## Process
step 1) was to analyxe the data and find the basics that are common with the excel file and based off of that creating 5 visualizations.
Step 2) was to observing the visualizations and thinking answers this data can provide from the business perspective.
3) To create visualizations link together on a dshboard.
4) Final step to create power point presentation.

## Results
I chose Option 2 (airbnb data).
I created 5 visualizations based on which neighborhood i would like to buy a property and what type and why?

Q1: Which Zipcode/ area has the best revenue?
- I chose a bar chart that states Manhattan's listings are higher in price than all the other ones and private property would definitely be something people give most money for.

Q2: How many listings in each neighbourhood and the average price (to figure out the competition in the market)?
- I chose Maps for that, after setting up the parameters set where I used neighbourhood, counts of Airbnb and average price to display an overview of the areas. Maps helped me displaying exactly what I wanted.

Q3: What does the data says about the no. of beds in a property?
- For this I used Text Tables, using the distinct Host ID  count and beds. My result was 1-4 beds are most popular and that in turn I could link to my maps visualization to see the outcome For ex:- which city has properties with most no. of beds with average price.

Q4: What is the link to the no. of beds and Price?
- Bar chart with Average price and Distinct count of beds gave me the average Price people list if they have 1-16 bedrooms on a property which would help my clent gives numbers she could make if she buys property with let's just say 4 beds.

Q5:- What is the prediction of average increase in airbnb price and count increae of airbnb's in the coming 9 years?
- Line chart with forecasting gave me a visualization that it is going to increase either way and we will have some profits in the future.



## Challenges 
Compared to other projects this one was fun and easier to deal with.

## Future Goals
Tackle Option 1 in my free time.
